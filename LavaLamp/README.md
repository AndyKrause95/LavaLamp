# Lavalamp

## Logic:
- bottom is heat-source
- bubbles have buoyancy
- buoyancy increases with heat
- heat 'charges' while being closer to the bottom
- heat decreases with distance to bottom
- bubbles are constraint by canvas container
- bubbles will have a velocity bias going straight up
- bubbles should not be bouncing around like ping-pong

## Implementation 
## Buoyancy:
